# Season 4, Episode 4 - Solution Design and Testing

This session picks up from where [Season 1, Episode 10](../../Season-01/0110-UnitTests) left off with unit tests and solutions.  We're going to look at structuing solutions, when and how to grow projects into class libraries and how to structure test projects for better management and sanity.

I've recently written a [blog post on the topic of growing a project into an entire system](https://dev.to/dotnet/my-favorite-c-features-part-4-project-structure-454p) and we will expand on that post with samples and discusion in this session.

## StyleCop Analyzers

.NET provides the ability to build and use Analyzers on your code.  Analyzers are .NET objects that run against your project at build time and provide feedback on code style, structure, and can even provide suggested fixes for your code.  You can find many analyzers on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=analyzers&sortOrder=package-download-count) that can help you write better code, faster.

In this session, we're going to work with the [StyleCop](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StyleCop.Analyzers) and [xUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit.analyzers/) analyzers
