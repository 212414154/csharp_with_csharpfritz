    "\n",
    "C# is an object-oriented language in which everything is an object, with the type `object` as the most basic types that all other types inherit from. In this session, we will learn to create our own types and how they can relate to other types using Interfaces and various scopes.\n",

    "## First, a word on memory utilization and garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory with C# and .NET is dynamically allocated and reclaimed by the .NET runtime as you no longer reference variables.  The .NET **Garbage Collector** runs occasionally, freeing memory that was previously used by variables.  There are ways to tune the garbage collector and in-depth studies of how it manages memory that are much more advanced than this part of the series.  If you'd like to read more, check the [official .NET garbage collector documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals)\n",

    "## The Class keyword and defining reference types\n",
    "\n",
    "The `class` keyword is used to create the most common type, a reference type, that you can create and interact with using C#.  As a reference type, every instance of your classes will be stored on the memory heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are declared with a name, a block of content, and with one or more access modifiers.  That syntax is followed by curly-braces `{ }` that enclose the contents of the class definition.  Let's declare our first class for use in this notebook:"
