    "# Session 1: Types, Keywords, and Operators with C#  #\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first session, we're going to start learning about object-oriented programming with C#.  We'll touch on the very basics around variable types, language keywords, and how we can use operators to make variables work together for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is C# ?  #\n",
    "\n",
    "C# is a statically-typed, compiled, object-oriented language used with the .NET frameworks and runtimes.  Similar to Java in syntax and structure, C# programs are compiled and executed against a .NET runtime running on a computer.  The output of compiling C# code can be called a '.NET program'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A .NET Runtime is a collection of commands native to the computer operating system that instruct the computer how to interpret and run a .NET program. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different .NET runtimes available that give C# flexibility to run in many different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - .NET Framework - runs on Windows and support desktop user-interface, console, and server development\n",
    " - .NET Core - runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux with support for desktop user-interface, console, and server development\n",
    " - Xamarin - runs on iOS and Android devices with support for native application development on those devices\n",
    " - Unity - runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android devices with support for game development using the Unity3D tools\n",
    " - Mono - runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Web Assembly\n",
    " \n",
    "> A .NET Framework is a collection of programming instructions and tools that help you write a program of a specific type.  Examples of .NET Frameworks include Windows Forms, ASP.NET, Xamarin iOS, and Blazor\n",
    " \n",
    "C# requires a .NET runtime and frameworks for the appropriate program type to run.  The definition of the framework and runtime for a C# program are stored in a `.csproj` file.  We'll learn more about this file and structure in a future lesson.  For now, know that the .NET tools will help construct and manage this file for you when you specify what type of program you want to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C# uses a semi-colon to denote the end of a statement  #\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hard and fast rule, and you'll get used to it quickly.  Every statement in C# needs to end with a semi-colon `;`  This allows us to also have very flexible spacing in how we structure our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comment Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write comments by using the two forward-slash characters to indicate everything after them is a comment."
